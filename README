TODO

This coding project function used x86-64 assembly to implement stack backtrace and register dump. The function uses the frame pointer
to walk up the call stack, extract return addressesses, resolve them to symbol names using dladdr, and print both function names 
and a full dumpof general-purpose register values. The function first dump pushes and pops all the registers and then afterwards implement a loop which then 
leads to call the print backtrace entry. After that we implement the helper C function to debug the code and the project is finished.
